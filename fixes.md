Would it be worth including a minimal example of how if/else/for in list comprehensions would differ syntatically from a full on loop
Another obvious hint: most solutions depend on operator and functools, so it might be helpful to nudge students into digging a little into the documentation for those right before working through the assignment
  - these two are going to be covered Thursday in class and notes, and I mention how important they are for the HW

Last test in exclude is wrong: it should assert to evens rather than odds


Since most functions are compact, do they need docstrings or mostly in-line comments?

Should the instructions be more explicit about the need/convenience of chaining functions for further use? (Example: newlen to solve count_all)
I see a conflicting incentive: the functions are hard to debug because of nested operations and lazy evaluation, but its easy to find similar implementation examples online (how to use reduce, operator, etc) -> maybe something to be aware of when working through roadblocks during OH
